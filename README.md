# Vector Operations in C

This project is a menu-driven C program that performs basic operations on vectors.
It demonstrates the use of arrays, pointers, functions, and mathematical operations in C.

## Features
- Read vectors A and B
- Display vectors
- Vector addition (A + B)
- Dot product (scalar product)
- Scalar multiplication
- Distance between two vectors
- Menu-based user interaction

## Concepts Used
- Arrays and pointers
- Functions and parameter passing
- Loops and conditional statements
- Math library functions (`sqrt`, `pow`)
- C99 standard (variable-length arrays)

## How It Works
1. The user enters the vector dimension.
2. A menu is displayed with different vector operations.
3. The program asks the user to input vector values when required.
4. Selected operations are performed and results are displayed.

## Compilation
Make sure you have **GCC** installed.

```bash
gcc main.c -o vector -lm
